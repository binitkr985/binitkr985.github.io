# 🔐 PassForge – Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** *January 17, 2025*

PassForge (“the Extension”, “we”, “our”, “us”) is a privacy-first password generator browser extension designed to operate entirely on the user’s device.

Your privacy and security are core to PassForge’s design.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

**PassForge does not collect any personal data.**

Specifically, we do **not** collect, store, transmit, or process:

* Passwords (generated or entered)
* Usernames, emails, or form data
* Browsing history or visited websites
* IP addresses or device identifiers
* Usage analytics or telemetry
* Cookies or tracking identifiers

All password generation and insertion happens **locally in your browser**.

---

## 2. How the Extension Works

PassForge operates entirely offline and only performs actions when explicitly triggered by the user, such as:

* Clicking the “Insert” button in the extension popup
* Selecting “Generate strong password (PassForge)” from the right-click menu

The extension injects a temporary script into the active page **only at the moment of user interaction** to fill password fields.
No background monitoring or automatic injection occurs.

---

## 3. Data Storage

PassForge does **not** use:

* `localStorage`
* Browser extension storage APIs
* IndexedDB
* Cookies
* Cloud storage or servers

Once the popup is closed, all generated data is discarded from memory.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

PassForge does **not** integrate with or communicate with any third-party services, including:

* Analytics platforms
* Advertising networks
* External APIs
* Cloud infrastructure

Optional external links (such as the extension store page or donation links) are opened **only when the user clicks them**.

---

## 5. Permissions Explanation

PassForge requests only the minimum permissions required for functionality:

* **activeTab** – to insert a generated password into the currently active page upon user request
* **scripting** – to temporarily inject a content script for password insertion
* **contextMenus** – to provide an optional right-click password generation feature

These permissions are never used for background tracking or automation.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

PassForge is not designed to collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
Because no data is collected, stored, or transmitted, no special handling is required.

---

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect improvements or regulatory requirements.
Any updates will be published alongside the extension or its official repository.

Continued use of PassForge after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
